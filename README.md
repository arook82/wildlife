This project was done as a capstone to the Google Data Analytics Certificate. I used BigQuery to run SQL queries, Excel to create data visualizations, and PowerPoint to combine everything together. It was a lot of fun, especially getting to learn SQL coding better (though I still have a long ways to go).
